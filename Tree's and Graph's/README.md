#Tree's
###Basic Terminologies
  * It's a collection of nodes.
  * Top node is called **root** node.
  * **Edges** connect nodes.
  * Edges define parent and child nodes.
  * **Leaves**- Edges with no children.
  * **Siblings**- Nodes which share same parent.
  * **Path**- It is a sequence of nodes such that next node in the sequence is a child of the previous.
  * **Depth**- A node's length is a length of the path from the root.
  * **Height**- Maximum depth is the height of the tree.
  * **Ancestor and Descendent**- If a path exists between two nodes one is an ancestor and the other is a descendent.
  
###Tree Traversal's
####PreOrder- Read the parent before children.
####PostOrder- Read the parent after children.

###Binaray Tree's
* Nodes can have at most two children -> left child and right child
* A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.
* It give's us one more traversal technique i.e. **InOrder Traversal**

####Inorder Traversal- Read left child then parent and right child in the last.

###Type's of Binary Tree's
* **Full Binary Tree**- Each node has either 2 children or 0 children.
* **Perfect Binary Tree**- Full B.T. with each leaf at same depth. 
* **Complete Binary Tree**- All levels are completely filled except last level and last level has all keys as left as possible.
